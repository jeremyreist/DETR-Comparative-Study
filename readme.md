# Video Object Detection and Tracking using the Attention Mechanism: A Comparative Study

This project aims to investigate the effectiveness of DETR and its variants (Deformable DETR, Efficient DETR, TransVOD, and TrackFormer) for video object detection and tracking. We will evaluate the performance of these models using benchmark datasets such as MOT20 and YouTube-Objects and provide insights into their strengths and weaknesses.

## Introduction
The main goal of this project is to perform a comparative study of several recent extensions of DETR for video object detection and tracking. We will apply these models to video clips by breaking them down into frames and running the models on each frame.
